## Deploy Citizen in 3 Simple Steps

Transform your application infrastructure management from command-line complexity to an intuitive web experience in minutes.

<Warning>
**Prerequisites**: You need a server with Docker, Docker Compose v2.0+, and at least 4GB RAM. A domain name is required for production SSL setup.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step title="Run the Installer">
  Execute our one-command installer to automatically deploy Citizen with production-ready configuration.
  
  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citizenteam/citizen/main/install.sh | bash
  ```
  
  The installer will:
  - Configure development or production environment
  - Set up Traefik reverse proxy with SSL
  - Initialize PostgreSQL and Redis
  - Create admin user credentials
  
  <Check>
  Installation typically completes in 2-3 minutes with all services running.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Your Domain">
  Set up DNS records to enable automatic SSL certificates and subdomain routing.
  
  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Production Setup">
    ```bash
    # Required DNS A records
    yourdomain.com      A     YOUR_SERVER_IP
    *.yourdomain.com    A     YOUR_SERVER_IP
    ```
    
    <Warning>
    DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours. SSL certificates generate automatically after DNS is properly configured.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Development Setup">
    ```bash
    # Local development uses localhost
    # No DNS configuration required
    # Access via: http://localhost
    ```
    
    <Info>
    Development mode includes hot reload and debug tools like pgAdmin and Redis Commander.

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Development">
    1. Visit `http://localhost`
    2. Use default credentials or create new admin user
    3. Explore development tools at:
       - pgAdmin: `http://localhost:5050`
       - Redis Commander: `http://localhost:8081`
       - Traefik Dashboard: `http://localhost:8080`

## Verify Your Installation

Confirm all services are running correctly with our health check endpoints.

<CodeGroup>
```bash System Health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/health
```

```bash Detailed Metrics
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/health/detailed
```

```bash Component Status
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/health/ready
```
</CodeGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Expected Health Response">
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "environment": "production",
  "components": {
    "database": {"status": "healthy", "response_time": "2ms"},

  }
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting Installation Issues">
**Common Issues and Solutions:**

- **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 80, 443, 3000, 5432, and 6379 are available
- **Docker permissions**: Add your user to the docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
- **Memory issues**: Citizen requires minimum 4GB RAM for production workloads
- **SSL certificate failures**: Verify DNS propagation with `nslookup yourdomain.com`

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check service status
docker ps

# View logs
docker logs citizen-backend
docker logs citizen-frontend
docker logs traefik

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```
